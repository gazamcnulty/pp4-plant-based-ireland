                <p>Plant Based Ireland was founded by a group of like minded people as a way to share info and ideas about vegetarian and vegan foods in Ireland. We wanted to provide a space for people to explore veggie/vegan diets, where they can interact with others who share the same ideas and want to learn more. We want to shine a spotlight on our favourite restaurants, encourage those curious about plant based diets to give it a try and help the community grow and make friends.</p>

    <p>Ireland has a surprisingly high amount of veggie and vegan options available when it comes to restaurant dining, fast food takeaways and snacks on the go. Although the number of true vegan restaurants is in the minority, most eateries will have a plant based option on the menu in some form or another. While some may be a boring salad, others can be inventive delicious meals that are worth highlighting. We wanted Plant Based Ireland to be a place where users can share their experiences about plant based dining in Ireland, discuss their favourites and make suggestions.If it provides some free marketing to our favourite restaurants with plant based meals on offer , all the better.</p>

    <p>While the vegetarian / vegan communities are growing in Ireland, they are still relatively small compared to consumers of standard diets. We would hope that Plant Based Ireland provides a place for those curious about plant based diets to come and explore. It is a welcoming environment for any and all types of people. If it helps bolster the plant based community even a little bit, or if it encourages more users to get to know each other and become friends, we would consider that a win.</p>
