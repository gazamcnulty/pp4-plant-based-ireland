          <p>Plant Based Ireland is more than just a website - its a community. Everyone who reads the site, logs in, posts a link or comment, we are all interacting under the umbrella topic of plant based foods in Ireland. We want this community to grow , strengthen and diversify. To this end Plant Based Ireland will be hosting a number of events in the near future. These include online zoom calls with group meetings, competitions, social meetups, trade shows and parties. See below a list of our upcoming events hosted and organised by Plant Based Ireland. If you are interested in contributing to these events, if you want to help in any way, or if you want to host an event of you own, please contact us at plantbased@gmail.com</p>
